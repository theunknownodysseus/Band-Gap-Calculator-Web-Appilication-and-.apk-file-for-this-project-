## Band Gap Calculator

This repository contains the source code for a Band Gap Calculator web application. This application allows users to calculate the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in a material, known as the band gap energy.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

**Features:**

- Band Gap Calculation: Users can input the wavelength and band gap energy, and the application will calculate the band gap energy difference.
- Random Wavelength Generation: There's an option to generate a random wavelength for convenience.

**File Structure:**

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the web application.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for band gap calculation.
- `band_gap_calculator.apk`: APK file for the Android application version of the Band Gap Calculator.

**Band Gap Explanation:**

The application provides a brief explanation of band gap and its significance in materials. It illustrates how band gap affects the conductivity of materials, distinguishing between insulators and semiconductors.
